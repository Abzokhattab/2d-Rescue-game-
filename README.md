(This project won one of the best five out of 70 projects in my class in terms of the functionality and user interface)


Simulation Game Rules :

The game consists of a main simulation 10x10 grid where the whole map is taking place.
The game is a single player one, where the player is responsible for managing the rescue units
to handle buildings and citizens suffering from the disasters that ensue during gameplay
throughout the whole map. The main goal of the game is for the player to efficiently employ the
rescue units to rescue as many citizens and minimize the number of deaths. All the available
rescue units are assigned to the player at the start of the simulation. As the game proceeds
certain disasters start appearing throughout the map affecting different buildings and citizens.

Winning Conditions :

The game ends when all the planned disasters are either handled by rescuing the targeted
citizens or failing to do so, thus the death of these citizens. When all citizens are either rescued
or deceased the simulation game ends and the score of saves and losses is presented to the
player.

Cycles :

The game is cycle based meaning that time is represented as cycles passing within the
simulation. Each rescue task takes a specific number of cycles and each disaster reaches its full
effect in a specific number of cycles. The player controls the progression of the cycles.
